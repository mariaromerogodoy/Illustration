            <h1>Human Design Is Blowing Up. Following It Might Make You Leave Your Spouse</h1>
            <span style="font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif; font-size: 1.2em; color: rgb(33, 33, 33);">The astrology-like system uses birth dates to break people into personality types and even find love and riches. From sleeping arrangements to diets, some are taking it very seriously.</span>
        <p> According to human design, the New Age “synthesis” of astrology, the I Ching book of Chinese wisdom, Kabbalah, and the chakra system, “everyone should sleep in their own bed at night” to preserve their auras, says the blond 38-year-old Los Angeles County–based surfer, who’s been following the practice rigidly for the past five years. “She was not happy and really hated having to go back to her place,” says Day, now a human design coach with 11,000 followers on Instagram. He didn’t know how much the “auric distancing” bothered her, he says, “until she finally expressed it when we were breaking up.”

            Human design dictates that people inevitably fall into five archetypal personality categories: “manifestors,” generators, manifesting generators, reflectors, and projectors. The mystical, mechanical inner-discovery system turned Day’s life around when he spontaneously received a reading on a beach just outside of LA in August 2020. He was at a financial and emotional “rock bottom” amid the failure of his “beachproof” dog accessory brand, but that initial personality analysis represented “the first time
            Day was told that he was projector and that he shouldn’t hustle hard but instead follow the intuition of his spleen, the little-understood organ in the upper abdomen that is traditionally believed to be the seat of bad temper.
            
            “For a long time I had depression and talked terribly to myself,” the California native tells me over a Zoom call. “But human design showed me that I actually hated not being me.”</p>
            
            Human design, a philosophy that spans from self-improvement to more extreme beliefs like life being predetermined, alien influence on Earth, and a coming planetary shift, is approaching a high-watermark cultural moment. It might not be long before the phrase, “that’s so mani-gen” is as common, in certain circles, as “that’s so Leo.” Some human design coaches have more than 100,000 followers on social media, offering people advice on everything from love lives to how to get rich.
    
            <p> There are coaching programs and entire centers dedicated to learning and teaching the practice as retreats are cropping up in wellness hot spots from Puerto Escondido, Mexico, to Sofia, Bulgaria. Readings can cost hundreds of dollars; TikTok creator Kendra Hilty, who went viral after documenting how she fell in love with her psychiatrist, received $3,000 for three months of weekly human design readings, according to The Cut. Even as I’m writing this article, I pass a bookstore in Vancouver, British Columbia, with a human design book prominently displayed in its front window. someone actually saw me.”

                The buzz around this radical system has led people to take life-changing decisions like ending their marriages or moving countries after single readings, which can also be conducted with ChatGPT. “You may realize you don’t love your partner, you hate your job, you can’t stand where you live, and you’re dying inside,” Day says. But he tells WIRED there are culty elements in the ecosystem of training connected to this “new astrology.” 
                
                IN THE NEW season of Love is Blind: UK, contestant Patrick Justus, a human design coach and “splenic projector,” like Day, propels the phrase “trust your spleen” into the zeitgeist; the show has used the slogan in its marketing ads next to Justus wearing an eye mask. “Listening to my spleen is the best way for me to find the love of my life,” he tells one of his first dates on the show.
                
                After several promising dates with singer Aanu Adewole, Justus starts to doubt the message from his spleen, noting it is “silent.” He dumps Adewole after she appears reluctant to sing for him and confesses that if her mother vetoed him she would drop him. “I have to follow my spleen,” Justus tells her. “It breaks my heart to tell you I’m breaking up with you.” (It later emerged that another woman may have been pregnant with Justus’ child during the filming of the series and that he had omitted to mention it. In a statement Justus provided to the show for its reunion episode, he said: “2025 has been life-changing as I embrace the joy of becoming a father.”)
                
                Justus’ seemingly strict adherence to his human design is not an anomaly. One coach tells WIRED she decided to divorce her husband after doing a reading on a flight to Hawaii, where they were due to start a new life together. To follow the teachings attached to one’s human design is to “decondition” from the societal influences that have molded people to be not their true selves. But Redditors report being scared to “decondition” and make the drastic lifestyle changes required to bring them into greater accordance with their design.
                
                Others claim to have gone to extremes in attempts to live fully in accordance with the teachings and what Day describes as “not self-conditioning forces.” These supposedly show up when one is out of alignment with their design and can include frustration, anger, bitterness, or disappointment. The drastic measures some have taken to “self-harmonize” have included moving alone to remote areas. In an Instagram reel, one human design advocate promotes the consumption of “single-ingredient foods” such as polenta to live within their design.
                
                Erin Claire Jones, a human design coach with 172,000 followers on Instagram, says the detail in human design assessments is also part of its appeal.
                
                “I’ve seen the most skeptical people fall in love with it because it’s practical, but it’s also so specific,” she says, noting the rise of human design from the extreme fringes toward the mainstream in recent years reflects an increasing collective desire to “learn about ourselves,” warts and all. </p>
