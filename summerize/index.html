    Human design dictates that people inevitably fall into five archetypal personality categories: “manifestors,” generators, manifesting generators, reflectors, and projectors. The mystical, mechanical inner-discovery system turned Day’s life around when he spontaneously received a reading on a beach just outside of LA in August 2020. He was at a financial and emotional “rock bottom” amid the failure of his “beachproof” dog accessory brand, but that initial personality analysis represented “the first time someone actually saw me.”<br><br>
    Day was told that he was projector and that he shouldn’t hustle hard but instead follow the intuition of his spleen, the little-understood organ in the upper abdomen that is traditionally believed to be the seat of bad temper.<br><br>
    “For a long time I had depression and talked terribly to myself,” the California native tells me over a Zoom call. “But human design showed me that I actually hated not being me.”

    Human Design categorizes people into five personality types. Day discovered it in 2020 during a personal and financial low point after his business failed. A reading revealed he was a projector, meant to follow intuition rather than hustle. This helped him reframe his depression, realizing it came from living out of alignment with his true self.
